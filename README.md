# HTML Recipe Parser

A easy to use library to extract recipe information from any URL or HTML file compliant with schema.org's recipe schema. Available at [https://schema.org/recipe](https://schema.org/recipe).

Built with Typescript, types already included.

Currently only pages that present the information in the **JSON+LD** schema are supported. Most major recipe websites use this schema, which is also Google's recommendation.

## Installation

`npm install html-recipe-scraper`

## Reference

- `type Recipe (See format below)`
- `function parseURL(url: string): Promise<Recipe>`;
- `function parseHTML(html: string): Promise<Recipe>`;

Both `parseURL` and `parseHTML` return exactly the same results, the difference is that the URL function will downlaod the page and send it to `parseHTML` for processing.

## Basic usage

```
import { parseURL, parseHTML } from 'html-recipe-parser'

const myUrl = https://www.recipeswebsite.com/some-delicious-cookie

const recipe = await parseURL(myUrl)

// or with then/catch
parseURL(myUrl)
  .then(recipe => console.log(recipe))
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
```
